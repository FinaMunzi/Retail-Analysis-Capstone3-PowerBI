## I've learned that :
__________________________________________________________________________

•	Power BI is a colorful and powerful tool. It is a fun tool to work with as very straight forward.

•	The data can be single sheet and it can be created into multiple datasheet with different title for modeling the relationship.

•	We can easily create new measure as needed 

•	Modeling relationship determines the functionality of the chart output.

•	Data shows Coca-Cola is the most loved beverages in the US, in fact possibly could be in the world.

•	The analysis provides the performance of the brand, retailers and regions.
