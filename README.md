## I've learned that :
__________________________________________________________________________

•	Power BI is a colorful and powerful tool. It is a fun tool to work with as very straight forward.

•	The data can be single sheet and it can be created into multiple datasheet with different title for modeling the relationship.

•	We can easily create new measure as needed 

•	Modeling relationship determines the functionality of the chart output.

•	Data shows Coca-Cola is the most loved beverages in the US, in fact possibly could be in the world.

•	The analysis provides the performance of the brand, retailers and regions. 

## Changes made from original data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

•	Datasheet transformation from single data to three different datasheet.

•	Tried to understand the data by researching the retailers in the US and understood the Sodapop topped because of being in the industry from year 1897
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galco%27s_Soda_Pop_Stop)

•	Download the data and loaded into Power BI for transformation.

•	Created Cards, charts, map and added slicers.

•	Created interactive dashboard.
